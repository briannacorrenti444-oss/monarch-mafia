## About Section

I believe professional success and human-centered values aren't mutually exclusive — they're inseparable.

Through Monarch Mafia, I've built a platform that houses the many dimensions of purposeful work: advancing clean energy technology, deepening understanding of human psychology, preserving culture and creativity, and showing up for communities in need.

**What I'm focused on:**

**Climate Tech** — Working to accelerate the energy transition through innovation and practical deployment. [INSERT FROM LINKEDIN: Specific role and contributions, e.g., "Currently at NuScale Power, where I contribute to..."]

**Health & Human Development** — Committed to understanding relational psychology and personal growth through deep study. Currently working through 200+ foundational texts in philosophy and psychology.

**Culture** — Poetry, creative writing, and volunteering with kids in STEM. Preserving what makes us human in an age of AI.

**Community** — Hands-on service through homeless outreach and care package assembly. Showing up for people in tangible ways.

The through-line? Impact that puts people first.
